## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up CodeDrop on your local machine.

### üìã Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16.x or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/codedrop.git
   cd codedrop
   ```

2. **Create a MongoDB Atlas Cluster:**

   Instead of a local MongoDB setup, we‚Äôll use a MongoDB Atlas cluster for scalability and ease of use.

   - **Create a MongoDB Atlas Account:** If you don't have an account, sign up at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
   - **Set Up a New Cluster:** Follow the steps in the [MongoDB Atlas documentation](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/getting-started/) to create your new cluster.
   - **Get Your Connection URL:** Once the cluster is ready, go to the "Database" section in Atlas, click "Connect," and select "Connect your application." Copy the connection string.

   Update your `.env` file with the following, replacing `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster-url>` with your details:

   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/your-database-name?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
   ```

   This will connect your app to the MongoDB Atlas cluster.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the SvelteKit development server. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173` to view the application.

### üèóÔ∏è Building the Project

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a production-ready version of your project in the `build` directory.

### üîç Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```
